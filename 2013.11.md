# [GitHub's Lean Management Strategy](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3020181/open-company/inside-githubs-super-lean-management-strategy-and-how-it-drives-innovation)

* trusted with choosing what to work on

* employees are trusted with their time and energy

* Valve (\$2.5B), GitHub (\$1B) the only solution that works

* unpleasant and unimporant projects don't get done (as they shouldn't)

* unpleasant but important projects that get done will be rewarded

* good people are going to move around in search of the best learning
  opportunity

* _wheels under each desk_ symbol

* the days projects get allocated _head count_ by a bunch of people who
  don't even understand the work being done is over

What to do with the creativity surplus?

To join any project, people need readily accessible training material and documentation - otherwise orienting is difficult. Distribution network for information about the purpose of this company, how it works and what it should be making.

> **Make communication be the glue that holds the business together, not hierarchy**

Employees should be themselves and feel like their interests, projects and initiatives belong at the company - they will be able to start creating valuable work right away.

When you communicate internally with polished, clear, and well-produced content, it's easy to re-purpose that material for external communication.

> **GitHub is all about enhancing communication**

Every Friday the leaders share their thoughts and vision. People will follow good ideas and discard bad ones, don't force their direction.

People closest to the problem know the problem best and probably make the best decisions on it. Everyone in the company can contribute towards it and advise, but ultimately the decision sits with the one doing the work.

What's important to you in order to achieve the strategic goals?

> What you work on is up to you, but it must be within the bounds of what's important to the company.
Naturally self-motivated and passionate people always do the right thing.

100% rule: always be working on stuff that you find exciting and makes you fulfilled.

Collaborating on anything all the time is always better than just doing something yourself. The internet is just a substrate for communication.

What project you're on is based on what chat room you're in. The real office is the chat room.

We record things so that people can go back and watch important talks & meetings.

> **Don't try to be flat, be highly networked**

Everyone is different, look at the connections between team members and how information travels amongst them.

Be both strategic (how does this product fit within the broader strategy of the company?) and tactical (doing the work towards that strategic vision).

> **Your message is your hypothesis about how the world should be different,**
**and how you plan to make it that way**

Let your employees spread this message proudly, in their own way, through their own work.

# [Prototyping Web Applications in Rails 4](http://daniel.fone.net.nz/blog/2013/10/19/prototyping-web-applications-in-rails-4)

Even though for production you would give your app a lot more thought, this is the simplest and quickets way of putting ideas in code. In 30mins you can have the basics wired up, showcasing the bare bones functionality.

# [webnuts/post_json](https://github.com/webnuts/post_json)

**PostJson** is everything you expect from ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL with the added power and dynamic nature of a document database: free as a bird, no schemas.

**PostJson** combines features of Ruby, ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL to provide a great document database by taking advantage of PostgreSQL 9.2+ support for JavaScript (Google's V8 engine). We started the work on **PostJson**, because we love document databases and PostgreSQL.

# [Envconfig: Environmentally friendly Ruby configuration](http://blog.broadstack.com/envconfig-ruby-rails-configuration.html)

# [bkeepers/dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)

Dotenv loads environment variables from `.env` into `ENV`

Storing [configuration in the environment](http://www.12factor.net/config) is one of the tenets of a [twelve-factor app](http://www.12factor.net/). Anything that is likely to change between deployment environments - such as resource handles for databases or credentials for external services - should be extracted from the code into environment variables.

It is not always practical to set environment variables on development machines or continuous integration servers where multiple projects are run. Dotenv load variables from a `.env` file into `ENV` when the environment is bootstrapped.

# [broadstack/envconfig](https://github.com/broadstack/envconfig)

Converts ENV vars into Ruby hashes, knows how to map common envs such as DB, SMTP etc.
