* trusted with choosing what to work on

* employees are trusted with their time and energy

* Valve (\$2.5B), GitHub (\$1B) the only solution that works

* unpleasant and unimporant projects don't get done (as they shouldn't)

* unpleasant but important projects that get done will be rewarded

* good people are going to move around in search of the best learning
  opportunity

* _wheels under each desk_ symbol

* the days projects get allocated _head count_ by a bunch of people who
  don't even understand the work being done is over

What to do with the creativity surplus?

To join any project, people need readily accessible training material and documentation - otherwise orienting is difficult. Distribution network for information about the purpose of this company, how it works and what it should be making.

> **Make communication be the glue that holds the business together, not hierarchy**

Employees should be themselves and feel like their interests, projects and initiatives belong at the company - they will be able to start creating valuable work right away.

When you communicate internally with polished, clear, and well-produced content, it's easy to re-purpose that material for external communication.

> **GitHub is all about enhancing communication**

Every Friday the leaders share their thoughts and vision. People will follow good ideas and discard bad ones, don't force their direction.

People closest to the problem know the problem best and probably make the best decisions on it. Everyone in the company can contribute towards it and advise, but ultimately the decision sits with the one doing the work.

What's important to you in order to achieve the strategic goals?

> What you work on is up to you, but it must be within the bounds of what's important to the company.
Naturally self-motivated and passionate people always do the right thing.

100% rule: always be working on stuff that you find exciting and makes you fulfilled.

Collaborating on anything all the time is always better than just doing something yourself. The internet is just a substrate for communication.

What project you're on is based on what chat room you're in. The real office is the chat room.

We record things so that people can go back and watch important talks & meetings.

> **Don't try to be flat, be highly networked**

Everyone is different, look at the connections between team members and how information travels amongst them.

Be both strategic (how does this product fit within the broader strategy of the company?) and tactical (doing the work towards that strategic vision).

> **Your message is your hypothesis about how the world should be different,**
**and how you plan to make it that way**

Let your employees spread this message proudly, in their own way, through their own work.

# [Prototyping Web Applications in Rails 4](http://daniel.fone.net.nz/blog/2013/10/19/prototyping-web-applications-in-rails-4)

Even though for production you would give your app a lot more thought, this is the simplest and quickets way of putting ideas in code. In 30mins you can have the basics wired up, showcasing the bare bones functionality.

# [webnuts/post_json](https://github.com/webnuts/post_json)

**PostJson** is everything you expect from ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL with the added power and dynamic nature of a document database: free as a bird, no schemas.

**PostJson** combines features of Ruby, ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL to provide a great document database by taking advantage of PostgreSQL 9.2+ support for JavaScript (Google's V8 engine). We started the work on **PostJson**, because we love document databases and PostgreSQL.

# [bkeepers/dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)

Dotenv loads environment variables from `.env` into `ENV`

Storing [configuration in the environment](http://www.12factor.net/config) is one of the tenets of a [twelve-factor app](http://www.12factor.net/). Anything that is likely to change between deployment environments - such as resource handles for databases or credentials for external services - should be extracted from the code into environment variables.

It is not always practical to set environment variables on development machines or continuous integration servers where multiple projects are run. Dotenv load variables from a `.env` file into `ENV` when the environment is bootstrapped.

# [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/)

In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps.

#### 1. One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys.

If there are multiple codebases, it's not an app - it's a distributed system. Each component in a distributed system is an app, and each can individually comply with twelve-factor.

A deploy is a running instance of the app. This is typically a production site, and one or more staging sites. Additionally, every developer has a copy of the app running in their local development environment, each of which also qualifies as a deploy.

The codebase is the same across all deploys, although different versions may be active in each deploy. For example, a developer has some commits not yet deployed to staging; staging has some commits not yet deployed to production. But they all share the same codebase, thus making them identifiable as different deploys of the same app.

#### 2. Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

A twelve-factor app never relies on implicit existence of system-wide packages. It declares all dependencies, completely and exactly, via a dependency declaration manifest. Furthermore, it uses a dependency isolation tool during execution to ensure that no implicit dependencies "leak in" from the surrounding system. The full and explicit dependency specification is applied uniformly to both production and development.

Twelve-factor apps also do not rely on the implicit existence of any system tools.

#### 3. Store config in the environment

Strict separation of config from code. Config varies substantially across deploys, code does not.

A litmus test for whether an app has all config correctly factored out of the code is whether the codebase could be made open source at any moment, without compromising any credentials.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as "environments", but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.

#### 4. Treat backing services as attached resources

Backing services like the database are traditionally managed by the same systems administrators as the app's runtime deploy. In addition to these locally-managed services, the app may also have services provided and managed by third parties.

The code for a twelve-factor app makes no distinction between local and third party services. To the app, both are attached resources, accessed via a URL or other locator/credentials stored in the config. A deploy of the twelve-factor app should be able to swap out a local MySQL database with one managed by a third party (such as Amazon RDS) without any changes to the app's code.

Resources can be attached and detached to deploys at will. For example, if the app's database is misbehaving due to a hardware issue, the app’s administrator might spin up a new database server restored from a recent backup. The current production database could be detached, and the new database attached - all without any code changes.

#### 5. Strictly separate build and run stages

The build stage is a transform which converts a code repo into an executable bundle known as a build. Using a version of the code at a commit specified by the deployment process, the build stage fetches and vendors dependencies and compiles binaries and assets.

The release stage takes the build produced by the build stage and combines it with the deploy's current config. The resulting release contains both the build and the config and is ready for immediate execution in the execution environment.

The run stage (also known as "runtime") runs the app in the execution environment, by launching some set of the app’s processes against a selected release.

Releases are an append-only ledger and a release cannot be mutated once it is created. Any change must create a new release.

Runtime execution, can happen automatically in cases such as a server reboot, or a crashed process being restarted by the process manager. Therefore, the run stage should be kept to as few moving parts as possible

#### 6. Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

Twelve-factor processes are stateless and share-nothing. Any data that needs to persist must be stored in a stateful backing service, typically a database.

Asset packagers use the filesystem as a cache for compiled assets. A twelve-factor app prefers to do this compiling during the build stage, such as the Rails asset pipeline, rather than at runtime.

Sticky sessions are a violation of twelve-factor and should never be used or relied upon. Session state data is a good candidate for a datastore that offers time-expiration, such as Memcached or Redis.

#### 7. Export services via port binding

The twelve-factor app is completely self-contained and does not rely on runtime injection of a webserver into the execution environment to create a web-facing service. The web app exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port, and listening to requests coming in on that port.

The port-binding approach means that one app can become the backing service for another app, by providing the URL to the backing app as a resource handle in the config for the consuming app.

#### 8. Scale out via the process model

In the twelve-factor app, processes are a first class citizen. Processes in the twelve-factor app take strong cues from the unix process model for running service daemons. Using this model, the developer can architect their app to handle diverse workloads by assigning each type of work to a process type. For example, HTTP requests may be handled by a web process, and long-running background tasks handled by a worker process.

The share-nothing, horizontally partitionable nature of twelve-factor app processes means that adding more concurrency is a simple and reliable operation. The array of process types and number of processes of each type is known as the process formation.

Twelve-factor app processes should never daemonize or write PID files. Instead, rely on the operating system’s process manager (such as Upstart, a distributed process manager on a cloud platform, or a tool like Foreman in development) to manage output streams, respond to crashed processes, and handle user-initiated restarts and shutdowns.

#### 9. Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

The twelve-factor app's processes are disposable, meaning they can be started or stopped at a moment’s notice. This facilitates fast elastic scaling, rapid deployment of code or config changes, and robustness of production deploys.

Processes should strive to minimize startup time. Ideally, a process takes a few seconds from the time the launch command is executed until the process is up and ready to receive requests or jobs. Short startup time provides more agility for the release process and scaling up; and it aids robustness.

Processes shut down gracefully when they receive a SIGTERM signal from the process manager. For a web process, graceful shutdown is achieved by ceasing to listen on the service port (thereby refusing any new requests), allowing any current requests to finish, and then exiting. Implicit in this model is that HTTP requests are short (no more than a few seconds), or in the case of long polling, the client should seamlessly attempt to reconnect when the connection is lost.

For a worker process, graceful shutdown is achieved by returning the current job to the work queue. For example, on RabbitMQ the worker can send a NACK; on Beanstalkd, the job is returned to the queue automatically whenever a worker disconnects. Lock-based systems such as Delayed Job need to be sure to release their lock on the job record. Implicit in this model is that all jobs are reentrant, which typically is achieved by wrapping the results in a transaction, or making the operation idempotent.

Processes should also be robust against sudden death, in the case of a failure in the underlying hardware. While this is a much less common occurrence than a graceful shutdown with SIGTERM, it can still happen. A recommended approach is use of a robust queueing backend, such as Beanstalkd, that returns jobs to the queue when clients disconnect or time out. Either way, a twelve-factor app is architected to handle unexpected, non-graceful terminations. Crash-only design takes this concept to its logical conclusion.

#### 10. Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

The twelve-factor app is designed for continuous deployment by keeping the gap between development and production small.

The twelve-factor developer resists the urge to use different backing services between development and production, even when adapters theoretically abstract away any differences in backing services. Differences between backing services mean that tiny incompatibilities crop up, causing code that worked and passed tests in development or staging to fail in production. These types of errors create friction that disincentivizes continuous deployment. The cost of this friction and the subsequent dampening of continuous deployment is extremely high when considered in aggregate over the lifetime of an application.

Adapters to different backing services are still useful, because they make porting to new backing services relatively painless. But all deploys of the app (developer environments, staging, production) should be using the same type and version of each of the backing services.

#### 11. Treat logs as event streams

A twelve-factor app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream. It should not attempt to write to or manage logfiles. Instead, each running process writes its event stream, unbuffered, to stdout.

In staging or production deploys, each process' stream will be captured by the execution environment, collated together with all other streams from the app, and routed to one or more final destinations for viewing and long-term archival. These archival destinations are not visible to or configurable by the app, and instead are completely managed by the execution environment.

The event stream for an app can be routed to a file, or watched via realtime tail in a terminal. Most significantly, the stream can be sent to a log indexing and analysis system (Logstash, Slpunk etc.).

#### 12. Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

One-off admin processes should be run in an identical environment as the regular long-running processes of the app. They run against a release, using the same code and config as any process run against that release.

The same dependency isolation techniques should be used on all process types. For example, if the Ruby web process uses the command `bundle exec thin start`, then a database migration should use `bundle exec rake db:migrate`.
