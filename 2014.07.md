#### [App Server Arena: Part 1, A Comparison of Popular Ruby Application Servers](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/ruby-app-server-arena-pt1)

All around, we find that Unicorn's best use case is with a single, dedicated application running at all times behind a reverse proxy (nginx) and load balancer (haproxy or ELB on Engine Yard) that stick to a regular, request/response application flow cycle. It generally processes requests very fast and has a highly stable architecture.

I generally recommend running multiple Unicorn workers in production. I would take the number of CPU cores on a machine and multiply by 1.5, plus one or two depending on expected load and the application. This ensures you have enough processes to continue allowing workers to process requests if one happens to be stuck with a long running request, or is waiting on I/O or network response for an abnormal amount of time. This is because, unlike Thin or Puma, Unicorn is neither evented nor is it multi-threaded.
