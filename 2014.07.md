#### [App Server Arena: Part 1, A Comparison of Popular Ruby Application Servers](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/ruby-app-server-arena-pt1)

All around, we find that Unicorn's best use case is with a single, dedicated application running at all times behind a reverse proxy (nginx) and load balancer (haproxy or ELB on Engine Yard) that stick to a regular, request/response application flow cycle. It generally processes requests very fast and has a highly stable architecture.

I generally recommend running multiple Unicorn workers in production. I would take the number of CPU cores on a machine and multiply by 1.5, plus one or two depending on expected load and the application. This ensures you have enough processes to continue allowing workers to process requests if one happens to be stuck with a long running request, or is waiting on I/O or network response for an abnormal amount of time. This is because, unlike Thin or Puma, Unicorn is neither evented nor is it multi-threaded.

Your landing page needs to look credible and clearly explain the the problem you're solving. You're targeting a special type of customer called early adopters to validate your idea. These are people who don't care about a name brand or beautiful design--they just want their problem solved.

Seriously question what problem you're solving and whether or not there is a real market for your idea. If you can't find people who will pay you before your product exists--you are not solving a big enough pain to have a viable business.

#### [Quick Tips for Effective Customer Interviews](http://uxceo.com/post/80877539095/quick-tips-for-effective-customer-interviews)

The goal of customer interviews is to collect detailed stories on customer mentality, behavior, and frustrations. Ideally, this is done in person, or over Skype, so you can dig deeper into the answers they provide. This builds empathy, uncovers richer insights, and reveals opportunities you could solve for that you may not have considered before.

> Tell me about the last time you waited in a long line.

> Have you ever been stopped by the police? What did you do?

> How do you manage your time?

Always start questions with “who, what, why, when, where, how.” 

**Why and how questions surface the most insightful answers.**
