# [Growing a good company culture](http://harmonia.io/blog/growing-a-good-company-culture/)

> Culture is what a group of people naturally do when nobody is watching.

The separation is an illusion, because each of those roles is meaningless without the others. There's no way for any one of those parts of a company to be successful independently from the others. While they may have different strengths and areas of focus, everyone should feel like they are part of the same team, working together and supporting each other to both define and then achieve the team's goals.

One way of encouraging change is to create a routine. Just like the repetition in a personal exercise routine can lead to self-sustaining change in behaviour, establishing routines within a team can help bring everybody in-step and help to harmonise ways of working and approaching tasks.

A set of clear, simple processes that the whole team can simply and easily repeat, day after day, week after week, can also help a team adapt to change more easily, both in terms of people joining and leaving the team, and handling unexpected changes in the team's environment.

# [Spotify Engineering Culture (part 1)](http://blog.crisp.se/2014/03/27/henrikkniberg/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1)

Squads - small (&lt; 8), autonomous, cross-functional, self-organizing team. Long-term mission. What to build, how to build it & how to work together. Squads are aligned at the long-term vision level & short-term goals which get re-negotiated quarterly.

> Be autonomous, but don't sub-optimise. The company overall mission is more important than the mission of any individual squad. **Loosely coupled but tightly aligned.**

Strive for a balance between consistency & flexibility.

Culture on sharing rather than owning (internal open-source culture).

Collaborate with each other to find the best solution.

> If you need to know exactly who is making decisions, you are in the wrong place.

Focus on easy releases so that you can release often. Small & frequent releases.

Infrastructure Squads - making it easier for everyone else to get on with their job. Continuous delivery, monitoring, CI etc.

Client App Squads - iOS, Web, Android etc.

Feature Squad - Search, playlist etc.

Enable & support, avoid handing off like the plague.

> There are plenty of areas for improvement, so we'll keep experimenting.

Release trains & feature toggles. Releases depart every week, like trains. They are predictable and reliable. Hide unfinished features with a feature toggle. Releasing unfinished features exposes integration problems early and it minimizes the need for code branches. Unmerged code hides problems and is a form of technical debt (inventory).

> Trust is more important than control. Why would you hire someone that you don't trust?

No politics. No fear.
