# [Growing a good company culture](http://harmonia.io/blog/growing-a-good-company-culture/)

> Culture is what a group of people naturally do when nobody is watching.

The separation is an illusion, because each of those roles is meaningless without the others. There's no way for any one of those parts of a company to be successful independently from the others. While they may have different strengths and areas of focus, everyone should feel like they are part of the same team, working together and supporting each other to both define and then achieve the team's goals.

One way of encouraging change is to create a routine. Just like the repetition in a personal exercise routine can lead to self-sustaining change in behaviour, establishing routines within a team can help bring everybody in-step and help to harmonise ways of working and approaching tasks.

A set of clear, simple processes that the whole team can simply and easily repeat, day after day, week after week, can also help a team adapt to change more easily, both in terms of people joining and leaving the team, and handling unexpected changes in the team's environment.

# [Spotify Engineering Culture (part 1)](http://blog.crisp.se/2014/03/27/henrikkniberg/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1)

Squads - small (&lt; 8), autonomous, cross-functional, self-organizing team. Long-term mission. What to build, how to build it & how to work together. Squads are aligned at the long-term vision level & short-term goals which get re-negotiated quarterly.

> Be autonomous, but don't sub-optimise. The company overall mission is more important than the mission of any individual squad. **Loosely coupled but tightly aligned.**

Strive for a balance between consistency & flexibility.

Culture on sharing rather than owning (internal open-source culture).

Collaborate with each other to find the best solution.

> If you need to know exactly who is making decisions, you are in the wrong place.

Focus on easy releases so that you can release often. Small & frequent releases.

Infrastructure Squads - making it easier for everyone else to get on with their job. Continuous delivery, monitoring, CI etc.

Client App Squads - iOS, Web, Android etc.

Feature Squad - Search, playlist etc.

Enable & support, avoid handing off like the plague.

> There are plenty of areas for improvement, so we'll keep experimenting.

Release trains & feature toggles. Releases depart every week, like trains. They are predictable and reliable. Hide unfinished features with a feature toggle. Releasing unfinished features exposes integration problems early and it minimizes the need for code branches. Unmerged code hides problems and is a form of technical debt (inventory).

> Trust is more important than control. Why would you hire someone that you don't trust?

No politics. No fear.

# [Zen and The Art Of Infrastructure Maintenance](http://devops.com/blogs/zen-and-the-art-of-infrastructure-maintenance/)

Those in a state of serenity will continue to create that which maintains the state of serenity or peace of mind; those that are not in a state of serenity are unable to escape a vicious cycle of build-fix-build-fix, never achieving peace of mind. Ultimately, the serenity of the creator is the key test for the quality of creation.

If the machine produces tranquility, it’s right. If it disturbs you, it’s wrong until either the machine or your mind is changed.

# [Variance - build powerful web data visualizations](https://variancecharts.com/)

In Variance, data graphics are created using special new data visualization tags that work like regular HTML — tags like `<chart>`, `<line>`, `<point>`, and `<repeat>`. These independent components can be composed together to build custom data graphics, with a set of rules much like a language’s grammar.

# [TDD is dead. Long live testing.](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html)

Step two is to rebalance the testing spectrum from unit to system.

Test-first units leads to an overly complex web of intermediary objects and indirection in order to avoid doing anything that's "slow". Like hitting the database. Or file IO. Or going through the browser to test the whole system. It's given birth to some truly horrendous monstrosities of architecture. A dense jungle of service objects, command patterns, and worse.

Less emphasis on unit tests, because we're no longer doing test-first as a design practice, and more emphasis on, yes, slow, system tests. (Which btw do not need to be so slow any more, thanks to advances in parallelization and cloud runner infrastructure).

# [Test-induced design damage](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html)

Hiding access to Active Records behind a Repository serves only as a way to disconnect the application from the database for "fast test" purposes. It does not clarify the design of the application itself. If you did not look or care about the tests, you wouldn't look at the "after code" and say "BETTER!".

Mocking all that away to test just whether it'll send this redirect or that notice doesn't make the least bit of sense to me. Controllers are meant to be integration tested, not unit tested.

The view is at the top layer of the MVC cake, the appropriate testing metaphor for the vast bulk of that is system testing: End-to-end.

Just like your general code base, your testing base needs regular pruning too.

Test models with intricate logic through model tests, but don't bother trying to separate them from the database. Use the power of testing fixtures and the case-transaction loop to avoid having to do expensive and excessive setup work for every case, and merely tailor your prototypical fixtures to the case at hand by changing the single state needed.

Test controllers using integration tests. Don't even try to make it fit under the unit testing paradigm. Resist the urge to extract session logic, like checking permissions, or auxiliary views, like emails, into a command object just so you can mock boundaries and have "fast tests". It's skinny controllers, not anemic controllers, we're looking for.

Test views through system/browser testing. This is particularly true if your view is powered in part by JavaScript. You have to make sure that all that stuff works too.

Above all, you do not let your tests drive your design, you let your design drive your tests! The design is going to point you in the right direction of what layer in the MVC cake should get the most test frosting.

> The answer to how can I make it better, is how can I make it clearer, not how can I test it faster or more isolated.

The design integrity of your system is far more important than being able to test it any particular layer. Stop obsessing about unit tests, embrace backfilling of tests when you're happy with the design, and strive for overall system clarity as your principle pursuit.

# [Test Induced Design Damage?](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/01/Design-Damage.html)

What Jim did was to, very elegantly, separate concerns. The separation of concerns is an old design principle, first explained to us by David Parnas in his 1972 paper: On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules. One of the primary benefits of separating concerns is changeability.

> You separate behaviors that change at different times for different reasons. Things that change together you keep together. Things that change apart you keep apart.

GUIs change at a very different rate, and for very different reasons, than business rules. Database schemas change for very different reasons, and at very different rates than business rules. Keeping these concerns separate is good design.

Jim noted several times in his talk that once he had separated a concern, he could test that concern more easily, and the test would run faster because it wasn't coupled to the Rails framework.

# [TDD Is Fun](http://solnic.eu/2014/04/23/tdd-is-fun.html)

Write a test that describes expected behavior of your system and make it pass.

That’s how tests are guiding you, that’s how you’re designing your system based on the feedback of your tests. It’s a process, a journey that involves many small refactorings. You don’t stop after making your first test pass. You move on and discover missing pieces of the puzzle. It’s a lot of fun and it gives you great confidence that the code you just wrote works exactly like you want.

There are also cases where you’re just prototyping something. This is really a bad moment for unit testing.

Sometimes I would mock an interface as soon as I discover it. Another time I would just wait with mocking until I feel really confident that a given collaborator object shouldn’t be treated as an internal implementation detail.

# [TDD, Straw Men, and Rhetoric](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2014/tdd-straw-men-and-rhetoric)

Classical TDD does not involve mocking or other forms of synthetic isolation by definition. We even use the term "classical TDD" to mean "TDD without isolation".

I want my feedback to be so fast that I can't think before it shows up. If I can think, then I'll sometimes lose attention, and I don't want to lose attention.

TDD and isolation both break down in some situations, and learning to detect those situations in advance takes a lot of time.
