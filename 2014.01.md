# [Unit Testing Your Production Code With Metrics And Logs](http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2013-06-11-unit-testing-your-production-code/)

> We use Librato Metrics to store and visualize our data, and we're using Eric Lindvall's excellent metriks library.

Where metrics tell you all about what's going on, logs are the true soul of your application. Metrics only give you a numeric representation of what happened, logs tell you (ideally) why things happened. They're your audit trail of steps your application took to execute a specific task.

We're using Papertrail for log aggregation.
