## [20 Things I Should Have Known at 20](http://inoveryourhead.net/20-things-i-should-have-known-at-20/)

1. The world is trying to keep you stupid (people who are not educated are easier to get money from and easier to lead).

2. Do not have faith in institutions to educate you. You both learn and get respect from people worth getting it from by leading and doing, not by following.

3. Read as much as you can.

4. Connect with everyone, all the time.

5. Don’t waste time being shy.

6. If you feel weird about something during a relationship, that’s usually what you end up breaking up over.

7. Have as much contact as possible with older people.

8. Find people that are cooler than you and hang out with them too.

9. You will become more conservative over time (do the crazy stuff now).

10. Reduce all expenses as much as possible.

11. Instead of getting status through objects (which provide only temporary boosts), do it through experiences

12. While you are living on the cheap, solve the money problem. If you are currently living paycheck to paycheck, extend that to three weeks instead of two. Then, as you get better, you can think a month ahead, then three months, then six, and finally a year ahead. The goal is to get to a point where you are thinking 5 years ahead.

13. Learn to program.

14. Get a six pack while you are young.

15. Learn to cook.

16. Sleep well (otherwise you'll be inefficient).

17. Get a reminder app for everything. Do not trust "what you should be doing", trust your notes.

18. Choose something huge to do, as well as allowing the waves of opportunity to help you along.

19. Get known for one thing. Spend like 5 years doing it instead of flopping around all over the place. If you want to shift afterwards, go ahead. Like I said, choose something.

20. Don’t try to fix anyone.

## [Here is your assignment...](http://happywithless.tumblr.com/post/23480127273/your-assignment)

1. **You will receive a body.** You may like it or not, but it will be yours for the entire period.

2. **You will learn lessons.** Each day you will have the opportunity to learn lessons which you may like, think them irrelevant or stupid.

3. **There are no mistakes, only lessons.** Growth is a process of trial and error, experimentation. Failure and success is part of the same process.

4. **A lesson is repeated until it is learned.** Various forms until your learn it and move on.

5. **Learning lessons does not end.** If you are alive, there are lessons to be learned.

6. **There is not better than here.** When your there has become here, you will simply obtain another there that will, again, look better than here.

7. **Others are merely mirrors of you.**

8. **What you make of your life is up to you.**

9. **The answers lie inside you.**

10. **Whether you think you can or can't, you're right in either case.**

# [Life is a game. This is your strategy guide.](http://oliveremberton.com/2014/life-is-a-game-this-is-your-strategy-guide/)

As a young player, you’ll have lots of time and energy, but almost no experience. This is the time to level up your skills quickly. You will never have so much time and energy again.

* Keep your state high.
* Don’t demand too much willpower from one day.
* Attempt the most important tasks first.
* Reduce the need to use willpower by reducing choices.

A key part of playing the game is balancing your competing priorities with the state of your body. Just don’t leave yourself on autopilot, or you’ll never get anything done.

> Choosing the right tasks at the right time is most of the game.

The odds of anyone being born in their optimal location are virtually zero, so research your options, and consider moving early. Location is a multiplier to all of your skills and states.

The most important rule of money is never to borrow it, except for things that earn you more back.

It’s almost impossible to get rich working for someone else. Riches do not come from work alone, they come from  owning things – assets – that pay back more than they cost, and your own company is a powerful asset you can create from scratch. Compound your winnings into more assets, and eventually they can remove your need to work at all.

At the start of the game, you had no control over who you were or your environment. By the end of the game that becomes true again. Your past decisions drastically shape where you end up, and if you’re happy, healthy, fulfilled – or not – in your final days there’s far less you can do about it.

That’s why your strategy is important. Because by the time most of us have figured life out, we’ve used up too much of the best parts.
