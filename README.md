As I start diving deeper into a subject, I end up picking up a book (or two) and thus to understand something properly, `n` minutes is not enough. This helps me take away the important facts and enables me to quickly jump back into the full context of a specific topic (thank you, ack).

I find this approach of grouping _highlights_ into a monthly period to be the perfect balance between size (a few thousand lines per document at most) and cohesion (preserves the train of thought).

Making this public, as with any open source project, forced me to clean up the notes and focus on consistency and practicality.

I started writing this in vim, but since coming across [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io), I've found its left pane for editing, right pane for previewing to be a better fit for note-taking.
