As I start diving deeper into a subject, I end up picking up a book (or
two) and thus to understand something properly, `n` minutes is not
enough. This helps me take away the important facts and enables me to
quickly jump back into the full context of a specific topic (thank you,
ack).

I find this approach of grouping _highlights_ into a monthly period to
be the perfect balance between size (a few thousand lines per document
at most) and cohesion (preserves the train of thought).

Making this public, as with any open source project, forced me to clean
up the notes and focus on consistency and practicality enough to make
the overall approach better: everyone wins.
