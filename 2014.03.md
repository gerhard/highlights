# [Lita is a chat bot written in Ruby](http://www.lita.io/)

Lita is a chat bot written in Ruby with persistent storage provided by Redis. It uses a plugin system to connect to different chat services and to provide new behavior. The plugin system uses the familiar tools of the Ruby ecosystem: RubyGems and Bundler.

```
App = Webmachine::Application do |app|
  app.configure do |config|
    config.adapter = :Reel
    config.adapter_options[:websocket_handler] = proc do |websocket|
      websocket << "hello, world"
    end
  end
end
```

```
class WebsocketHandler
  def call(websocket)
    loop do
      message = websocket.read
      # do something with the message, call methods on other objects, log stuff, have your fun
    end
  end
end
```

[webmachine-ruby](https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby) makes it easy by allowing you to implement streaming APIs without much trouble, and I suppose it’ll only take a bit of JS to fallback from one to the other and provide an abstract connection to consumers.

# [Ruby Gotchas that will come back to haunt you](http://blog.elpassion.com/ruby-gotchas)

#### Use only `&&` / `||` operators

`and` / `or` operators have lower precedence than `&&` / `||`
`and` / `or` have lower precedence than `=`, while `&&` / `||` are of higher precedence
`and` / `or` have the same precedence, while `&&` has higher precedence than `||`

```
(surprise = true) and false # => surprise is true
surprise = (true && false)  # => surprise is false
```

#### Use only `==` operator

`==` / `===` / `eql?` / `equal?` are all different operators, meant for different situations.

#### Use `super` (no parantheses)

#### Inherit from `StandardError` (not Exception)

When you leave rescue statement empty, it means it will catch exceptions that inherit from StandardError, not Exception.

When you rescue Exception (which you should not), you’ll catch errors you won’t be able to recover from (like out of memory error). Also, you’ll catch system signals like SIGTERM, and in effect you won’t be able to terminate your script using CTRL-C.

#### Always use longer, more verbose version with classes wrapped by modules

`module` keyword (as well as `class` and `def`) will create new lexical scope for all the things you put inside.

`module Foo` creates the scope 'Foo', `class Bar`h creates new lexical scope (named 'Foo::Bar'), which has access to its parent scope ('Foo') and all constants declared in it.

`class Foo::Bar` creates another lexical scope, which is also named 'Foo::Bar', but here, it has no parent, and thus, no access to things from 'Foo' scope.

#### Never depend on built-in bang! methods return value

#### `attribute=(value)` always returns passed value

#### `private` will NOT make `self.method` private

You want `private_class_method :method_name` or `class << self`

# [Use An Ask, Don’t Tell Policy With Ruby](http://patshaughnessy.net/2014/2/10/use-an-ask-dont-tell-policy-with-ruby)

Naming methods is one of the most difficult and important things a programmer does. Picking a name for a method gives the reader a hint about what the method does, about what your intentions were when you wrote it.

Don’t imagine you are the computer. Don’t think about how to solve a problem by figuring out what Ruby should do and then writing down instructions for it to follow. Instead, start by asking Ruby for the answer.

> Objects encapsulate state. Don’t break that encapsulation.

When you send a message to an object, you should ask it for what you want, not tell it what to do or make assumptions about how it works internally.

# [Telling, Asking, and the Power of Jargon](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/02/11/telling-asking-and-the-power-of-jargon/)

The idea of **Tell, Don’t Ask**, is that objects should take responsibility for their state, and should not allow other objects to bypass encapsulation and mess with the state.

Functional programming is about expressions. It’s about composition. It’s about transforming data, not storing it.

When programmers talk to programmers, they use jargon. By using jargon words (or terms of the trade, as the fancy folk call them), we communicate efficiently and effectively—we interact at a much deeper level. Each piece of jargon is a shortcut for a whole lot of shared experience, and by using jargon words, we root our conversation at a deeper level.

But jargon has to be protected. Consistently misuse a jargon word, and it loses its deeper meaning. It it no longer evocative—it’s just a noise. And if our jargon becomes diluted, then we as an industry become less efficient at communicating—we have to make explicit what was once tacit. Our talk becomes pedestrian and pedantic, mechanical rather than allusive. We lose the superpower of description.
